# WGAN pytorch implementation

This is an implementation of the WGAN architecture to gain knoledge about pytorch and have some fun.

Pros of wgan vs dcgan:

    Better training stability
    Loss means somethin: Termination criteria

Cons of wgan vs dcgan:

    Longer to train (but as we have better training stability, we will probably spend less time playing with hyperparmeters)
